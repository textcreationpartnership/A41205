            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>To mimic Baudy Droll, and humble Farce.</l>

                  <p>O Sir, My Maſter has taken Phyſick to day— a kind of grumbling came over his Maw, which I doubt was a Surfeit got by eating of Raſhers of Bacon and poatch'd Eggs th'other day, with his Nephew <hi>Furniſh:</hi> but Doctor <hi>Quibus,</hi> the gibberiſh— ſputter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>French</hi> Doctor, tells him it is Melancholy, and that he muſt purge it away.</p>

                  <p>I tell yon Sir, the whole Family is employed, and all too little, to wait on him: He is turbulent to purpoſe, for a little yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh Powder the Doctor gave him, which he called <hi>Enemetic,</hi> has ſo claw'd him off, that there is the Devil and all to do with him.

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Sneak,</hi> I have met with a man, that has been this forty
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41722:29"/>eight years ſtudying a rare Project, and indeed, one that will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to all Curious Perſons; and eſpecially to Travellers; and he tells me, that now at laſt he has attained it; and that he ſhall have perfected his Deſign by that time the Patent can be got for it.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray, Madam, what is this rare Invention you ſpeak of?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, the Invention is extraordinary, it is a pair of Wings to fly into the Moon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, that is not poſſible.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>How unreaſonable you are now, not to believe another, and yet impoſe as impoſſible things on the Faith of others? And to tell you very freely, Mr. <hi>Sneak,</hi> my thoughts are, 'twill be ſooner effected than moſt of thoſe things you dream of: For you cannot but know, that <hi>Dedalus</hi> and <hi>Icarus</hi> could fly half way to the Moon; and of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, that could fly from high Towers, like Kites, or Eagles.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, it would be an admirable way of Travelling; I'll ſpeak to my Lady <hi>Medler</hi> about the Patent.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis good to ſpeak in time: It will be of extraordinary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to you; and I hope, worth the <hi>Vertuoſo</hi>'s while, labor and pains. He has ſtudied all the Mathematicks, and run thorow the Philoſophy of Atoms, of Weight and Gravity; weighed all ſorts of Air, and lain whole days on his Back, to obſerve the Motions of Kites, Swallows, Doves, Batts, and Butterflies, making Comments and Obſervations on their ſeveral Motions; and now at laſt Mr. <hi>Sneak,</hi> this Flying Man, having brought his Wings to perfection, intends to viſit the Moon ſhortly.</p>

                  <p>Let me adviſe him to get a Patent before he goes, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Art to one, leaſt he ſhould miſcarry: For I look upon the Voyage far more dangerous than that of <hi>Columbus,</hi> when he went in urſuit of the other World.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>As to the laſt, I may perhaps get him to communicate it to you: For he is almoſt afraid to own it after all, leaſt he ſhould be knock'd on the Head, by the Coachmen, Watermen and Seamen: For 'twill ſpoil their Trade. Beſides, ſome have perſuaded the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men, that there will (if this Project goes forward) be ſuch Clouds of Flying People in the Air, that 'twill hinder the Sun from ripening their Corn: So that he is afraid he ſhall be kill'd by them for the Invention; and he muſt be upon the Wing, out of the reach of ſhot, or in the Moon to ſecure himſelf.</p>

                  <p>O Pray Madam, be not angry, I was engaged in a very grand Deſign, one of the beſt Projects I ever yet met with, very feaſible and extreamly beneficial, which I will communicate to your Ladyſhip.</p>

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Sneak,</hi> I have met with a Project this day, ſo extraordinary, and ſo exceeding beneficial, both to us, and to the whole Kingdom, that I hug my ſelf, to have been ſo happy as to hear the firſt Propoſition of it, from the <hi>Vertuoſo</hi> himſelf — I will take you in for a Share, Mr. Sneak, we will make one another happy —</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>

                  <speaker>La. Med.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, there is a perſon come to Town, that was with me this day, that propoſes to build a Fleet of Sheeps all of <hi>Portland</hi> Stone, to ſave the Woods which begin to grow thin, and Timber ſcarce; and he will undertake to build them ſo thick, that no Bullet ſhall pierce them. Then we ſhall have Caſtles indeed floating on the Seas, as a modern Poet ſays.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>Sure that is not feaſible, which way can he do it; he muſt ſheath them all with Cork ſure?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La. Med.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, which way he does it, is a Secret; but he has brought it to Demonſtration already by a little one, the very Yards and Maſts are all of Stone too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sne.</speaker>
                  <p>But the Tackle and Sales are not made of Stone too, I hope.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>La. Med.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe we may not be beholden to Forreign Nations, and to promote the Growth of our own Nation, all the Sales are made of Tinn, and the Shrouds, Tackle and Cables of twiſted Wires. What need we then care for <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Norway?</hi>
